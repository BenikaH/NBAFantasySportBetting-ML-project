# ECS-289K-Term-Project: Daily Fantasy NBA Betting Algorithm

## Background

Daily Fantasy Sports websites such as [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/) and [Fanduel](https://www.fanduel.com/) offer sport fans the ability to draft fantasy teams and then place monetary bets based on confidence in their fantasy teams' performance. Our self-proposed term project for ECS289K (Practitioner's Approach to Data Science) was to create an algorithm that would generate fantasy teams that would break even against the average user, or ideally, outperform users to return a profit.
